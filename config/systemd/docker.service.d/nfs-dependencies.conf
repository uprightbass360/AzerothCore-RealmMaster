# AzerothCore RealmMaster - Docker NFS Dependencies
# Ensures Docker waits for NFS mounts before starting to prevent race conditions
# where containers create local directories before NFS mounts are ready

[Unit]
# Wait for NFS mounts to be active before starting Docker
After=nfs-azerothcore.mount nfs-containers.mount

# Require the primary backup NFS mount (critical for data integrity)
Requires=nfs-azerothcore.mount

# Prefer the containers NFS mount but don't fail if unavailable
Wants=nfs-containers.mount
